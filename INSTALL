 Run "sh autogen.sh" to generate the configure script, then:

 sh configure [options]

 --prefix=

        The prefix to put all installed files under. It defaults to
        /usr/local, so the binaries will go into /usr/local/bin, sbin,
        manpages into /usr/local/share/man, etc.

	The base directory for arch-independent files. Defaults to
	$prefix/share.

 --with-build-deb

	To enable build with deb package

 --with-build-rpm

	To enable build with rpm package

 --with-pkgdst=

	Path where the package will be installed. By default all will be installed
	into path determinated by the --prefix option

 Run "make" to compile libnftnl, "make install" to install it in the configured paths.

 Configuration with package
 ==========================
 To enable build a package just configure one of the option:
	./configure --with-build-deb
	make build-deb
	or
	./configure --with-build-rpm
	make build-rpm
 If you need to install a package to a specific location
 you have to specify the path using the --with-pkgdst option:
